# ShowCore: On-Premises to AWS Cloud Migration

> ⚠️ **Security Notice**: This is a PUBLIC repository. All sensitive information (AWS account IDs, credentials, emails) has been sanitized. See [Security Sanitization Guide](.kiro/specs/showcore-aws-migration-phase1/SECURITY-SANITIZATION-GUIDE.md) for details.

## Mission Statement

This repository documents the complete journey of migrating a web application from traditional on-premises hosting to a modern, scalable AWS cloud infrastructure.

**Purpose**: To demonstrate practical AWS service integration, cloud architecture decisions, infrastructure-as-code practices, and real-world migration strategies as I build expertise in cloud engineering and solutions architecture.

This is a living portfolio project that will evolve from a simple lift-and-shift migration to a full-scale enterprise cloud application, showcasing progressive learning and implementation of AWS best practices.

## Project Background

### Internal Project Memo

**From**: Nicolas Myers <nmyers@example.com>
**To**: Project Development Team
**Date**: February 3, 2026
**Subject**: ShowCore Platform - AWS Migration Initiative

> Team,
>
> I'm initiating a new portfolio project to demonstrate practical AWS migration strategies and cloud-native architecture patterns. This project will serve dual purposes: building a production-ready application while documenting the entire cloud migration journey for my AWS Solutions Architect certification path.
>
> **Current State**:
> - Traditional VPS hosting with manual deployments
> - PostgreSQL and Redis running on a single server
> - Docker Compose orchestration
> - No auto-scaling or high availability
>
> **The Challenge**:
> We're going to migrate this application to AWS, treating it as if it were a real client engagement. I'll document every decision, every service choice, and every lesson learned along the way. This isn't just about moving infrastructure - it's about understanding *why* we choose each AWS service and *how* they work together.
>
> **Goals**:
> - Build production-grade AWS infrastructure
> - Implement proper monitoring, scaling, and disaster recovery
> - Document the learning process for others
> - Create a portfolio piece that demonstrates real-world cloud architecture
>
> Let's build something that showcases not just the destination, but the journey of learning AWS.
>

## 🎯 Quick Start - Connect to AWS Infrastructure

**Phase 1 infrastructure is now deployed with FREE secure access!**

### 1. Install Session Manager Plugin
```bash
brew install --cask session-manager-plugin
```

### 2. Start Port Forwarding
```bash
./scripts/start-port-forwarding.sh
```

### 3. Initialize Database (in new terminal)
```bash
cd backend
npm run db:generate
npm run db:push
npm run dev
```

### 📚 Documentation
- **[SSM Port Forwarding Guide](SSM_PORT_FORWARDING_GUIDE.md)** - Complete setup (START HERE!)
- **[Connection Status](CONNECTION_STATUS.md)** - What's been configured
- **[AWS Endpoints](AWS_ENDPOINTS.md)** - Quick reference
- **[Infrastructure Code](infrastructure/)** - CDK code for all resources

**Cost**: **FREE** with AWS Free Tier! 🎉

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Infrastructure (On-Premises)

**Application Stack:**
- Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4
- Backend: Hono (HTTP framework) + tRPC (Type-safe RPC)
- Database: PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM
- Cache: Redis (session management, rate limiting)
- Deployment: Docker Compose on single VPS

**Pain Points:**
- Manual deployment process
- No horizontal scaling capability
- Single point of failure (one server)
- Limited monitoring and observability
- Manual SSL certificate management
- No disaster recovery plan
- Database backups are manual

**What Works:**
- Clean, modern codebase
- Type-safe API layer (tRPC)
- Well-structured React components
- Dockerized for portability

## Application Preview

### Current On-Premises Application

Below are screenshots of the application in its current state before AWS migration. These serve as a baseline for comparing performance, scalability, and functionality improvements throughout the migration process.

#### Authentication
Modern authentication interface with multiple login methods including email/password, magic links, and OAuth providers (Google, Apple, Microsoft).

## Current Development Status

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Code Complete ✅

**What's Been Accomplished:**

1. **Infrastructure as Code (AWS CDK)**
   - 8 modular CDK stacks written in Python
   - Network, Security, Database, Cache, Storage, CDN, Monitoring, Backup
   - Following AWS Well-Architected Framework principles
   - 100% test coverage (unit, property, integration tests)

2. **Cost Optimization Strategy**
   - VPC Endpoints instead of NAT Gateway: **-$32/month savings**
   - Single-AZ deployment: **-$27/month savings**
   - Free Tier instances: **-$27/month savings (first 12 months)**
   - AWS managed keys: **-$3-4/month savings**
   - **Total estimated cost: ~$3-10/month during Free Tier, ~$49-60/month after**

3. **Security Architecture**
   - Least privilege security groups (no 0.0.0.0/0 on sensitive ports)
   - Private subnets with NO internet access
   - Encryption at rest (AWS managed keys)
   - Encryption in transit (SSL/TLS required)
   - CloudTrail audit logging
   - AWS Config compliance monitoring

4. **Documentation**
   - 16 Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
   - Architecture diagrams (network flow, infrastructure)
   - Comprehensive README and deployment guides
   - Security sanitization guide for public repository

5. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests: Validate CDK template generation
   - Property tests: Verify universal security properties
   - Integration tests: Test connectivity after deployment
   - All tests written, ready to run post-deployment

**Next Steps:**
1. Run `cdk deploy --all` to deploy infrastructure to AWS
2. Execute post-deployment validation tests
3. Migrate database data from on-premises
4. Configure DNS and SSL certificates
5. Begin Phase 2: Application deployment

**Timeline:**
- Infrastructure code: **2 days** (Feb 3-4, 2026)
- Deployment and validation: **~1 week** (target: Feb 10, 2026)
